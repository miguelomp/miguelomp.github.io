# Hello to all of myself

I'm Miguelâ€”an introvert, a curious about how everything works, a thinker, a developer, a systems architect, a Cosmere fan, anime/manga fan, and, like everyone else, just a person figuring things out. Over the last couple of years, I've found myself stuck in a sort of frozen state, merely existing rather than truly living. Deep down, I know part of this has been driven by fearâ€”fear of change, fear of pain, and probably more fears I have yet to identify.

To give some context, I'm a Venezuelan who emigrated to Spain in 2021, right after the pandemic, seeking a better life. In many ways, I have found that better life. I feel more comfortable with my surroundings, but over time, I allowed fear of people and social interactions to creep in. Little by little, I started to withdraw, detaching myself from meaningful social connections. A couple of years later, merely existing and ignoring the concerns of my partner and closest friends, Iâ€™m finally starting to understand the consequences of not addressing it earlier.

Now, Iâ€™ve taken the first step. Thereâ€™s some regret for the time lost and for the scars Iâ€™ve left behind, but thereâ€™s also a lot of hope. I have love for my closest connections and, most importantly, for myself. This marks the beginning of a new chapter in my lifeâ€”one filled with fear, yes, but also with excitement for the growth that lies ahead.

Hereâ€™s to the journey.

# That Was a Heavy Helloâ€”Let Me Share More About Myself

I donâ€™t want this first post to be all about the tough things Iâ€™m going through, so let me tell you more about what I do for fun or for a living. Well, Iâ€™m a software engineer (shocking, right?) who graduated in 2018 from the Universidad de Los Andes in MÃ©rida, Venezuela. Iâ€™ve always been a quiet person with people Iâ€™m not confident around, but once I get past that barrier, I can be quite clumsy and much more talkative. One advantage of being the way I am is that Iâ€™m a great listener and very supportive.

What else? I watch a lot of YouTube, always learning new things about tech or watching commentary on video games, books, anime, and manga. I love video games that challenge me to solve complex problems, like Satisfactory, but I also really enjoy roguelikes like The Binding of Isaac.

Back in Venezuela, I loved going to the mountains to feel the cold and the calmness. This is something I want to bring back into my life. I enjoy going out to eat or drink and just chilling. Once in a very long while, I like to partyâ€”not so much for myself but because I love seeing my favorite people enjoy themselves. I also love driving out of the city and discovering new places, though I wouldnâ€™t call myself a traveler. Iâ€™m not the type to constantly hop on planes, haha.

Professionally, as I mentioned before, Iâ€™m a software engineer. What I love most about my profession is that Iâ€™m constantly learning new things. When the job allows it, I love experimenting with new technologies. Iâ€™m a bit obsessed with Docker and Pythonâ€”not enough to call myself the best (hello, imposter syndrome!)â€”but I know Iâ€™m very skilled. My enthusiasm sometimes means my manager has to rein me in because Iâ€™m always trying to improve the workplace with new tools or processes to enhance the development experience. In short, I consider myself a strong team supporter, and Iâ€™ve been told Iâ€™m a good mentor tooâ€”hehe.

Now it feels a little more balanced, right? Iâ€™ll be using this space to document my progress on my inner journey, share opinions about life, and take notes for myself while sharing knowledge about the programming world.

Drink water!
