# How to Count Successful DAG Runs Between Two Dates
I wanted to share this tip in case I forget it later. Recently, I needed to compare the number of successful DAG runs during two time intervals. This happened because our backend server's activity spiked to 100% and then stabilized at around 30% hours later.

Hereâ€™s how I approached it using the Airflow UI:

## Filtering DAG Runs in the UI
1. Navigate to `Top panel > Browse > DAG Runs`.
1. Apply filters to narrow down the DAG runs you need.
1. Adjust the page size:
    - First, set the result size to a higher value, e.g., 100 per page.
    - Check the updated page size in the URL.
    - Manually change the page size in the URL to the maximum number of results from your filter + 1.
    
    This ensures all results are displayed on one page. Note: Be cautious with large resultsâ€”so far, Iâ€™ve had no issues handling up to 700 items.

## Using JavaScript to Count Successful DAG Runs
For my specific case, I used the following JavaScript snippet in the browser console to count successful DAG runs between two dates:

```javascript
$x("//tr")
    .map(x => x.getElementsByTagName("td"))
    .map(x => x[3])
    .filter(x => x !== undefined)
    .map(x => x.innerText)
    .reduce((acc, x) => {acc[x] = (acc[x] || 0) + 1; return acc;}, {})
// returns
{
    "somedag1": 4,
    "somedag2": 11,
    "somedag3": 13,
    "somedag4": 3,
    "somedag5": 3
}
```

## Notes
- This script extracts the DAG names and counts their occurrences. Update the XPath or logic as needed for your table structure.
- If anyone knows a better way to achieve this without leaving the UI, feel free to share! ðŸ˜†
